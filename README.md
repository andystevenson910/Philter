# Philter
Philter is a Tinder like app that helps you sort through your photos, using a KNN style AI, that serves you photos it thinks you no longer need.

As of now, the code is not for modification and further this code is explicitly not for license currently. That being said, the code is public so I can't really stop you. So its honor system I guess. Feel free to look at the code and make your own.

This project uses MobileNetV2 embeddings, Â© TensorFlow authors, Apache 2.0

# Privacy Policy for Philter

_Last updated: October 14th 2025_

At **Philter**, we believe in privacy. We don’t collect your data, and we don’t want it. Please don’t send it to us.

This privacy policy only exists because it’s a requirement for the Google Play store as we require photo access.

## What this means
- Everything in runs directly on your device, including the AI.
- We will **never** ask for your data, for you to create a login, or for access your photos.
- Your photos never leave your phone.
- No servers, no cloud, no hidden tracking.

We value ~~good~~ working code and good ethics — and that means respecting your privacy first.

Should we decide for some ungodly reason that this app should require a change to that rule, we will notify you prior and give you an option to opt out.
We may update this policy from time to time. When we do, we’ll update the ‘Last updated’ date,  and try our hardest to notify you in the update description as well.

We do not see this policy changing any time soon with one caveat: Google Photos. At some point we would like to implement a connection to google photos so it syncs your deletion on your device with deletion on google photos. However this is currently not in scope and a while out.
